                    <p>
                        The VR46 Riders Academy was founded in 2013 with the goal of supporting Italian riders in
                        becoming
                        top level peformers
                        in motorsport, guiding them on their journey to the world of professional motorcycle riders.

                        Talent alone is not enough to succeed in motor sports: you need determination, sacrifice,
                        commitment
                        and…a mentor like
                        no other: Valentino Rossi.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our riders are the interpreters of a project which is rooted in a land that lives and breathes
                        motor
                        sports, and
                        nourishes a mentality that is also an indissoluble lifestyle based on the values of friendship,
                        respect, loyalty and
                        hard work.

                        Regardless of the individuals, who adopt their method with different approaches, the principles
                        of
                        the Academy remain
                        firm and immutable.

                    <h2>The Motor Ranch</h2>
                    <p>
                        It was an afternoon like any other at “the Cava”, with the pleasant tiredness in the arms, and
                        the strong smell of tar
                        in everyone’s noses, carried by the September breeze among the gray warehouses. But the
                        afternoon snack ritual, a key
                        appointment after riders spent several hours on a motorbike making crossings on that track
                        half-beaten by the rollers,
                        coincided with the turning point for the group. With his suit unbuckled and a salami sandwich in
                        his hands, Valentino
                        resolutely tackled “the” question: “This place is too dangerous, we have to look for a real
                        track”. It was the start of
                        a new journey, in a place that soon became more than a racing track: the Motor Ranch.

                        70 hectares of uncontaminated nature on the Pesaro hills, which will be transformed in the ideal
                        motorcross track. The construction began immediately, with th design of a hypothetical path and
                        a tiller to make it real on the ground. After a few days of work Vale, Sic, and Paso, who wer in
                        charge of track approval, gave their green light.
